This is a demo of comments done using `Staticman <http://staticman.net>`__

To see it in action, please click on the title `Sample Post With StaticMan Comments <http://staticman-demo.netlify.com/posts/sample-post-with-staticman-comments.html>`__

If you post a comment using the form below, it will be automatically saved in GitHub `here <https://github.com/ralsina/staticman-data/tree/master/data/entry-cache/posts>`__ and then, after a few seconds, `Netlify <http://netlify.com>`__ will pick up the change and rebuild and redeploy the site.

In the Nikola site, there is a special ``post.tmpl`` that will pick up that data and display the comments in the right places.

Neat, right?

Comments (with optional moderation), I keep all the data (including the comments) in Git, no lockin whatsoever!

Thanks Netlify and Staticman for an awesome job!

PD: There will be a description of how all the magic happens in a few days, but here's `the code <https://github.com/ralsina/staticman-data>`__ if you want to start guessing, and here's `how the automatic rebuild happens <https://getnikola.com/blog/from-zero-to-nikola-in-one-minute-without-installing-anything.html>`__
